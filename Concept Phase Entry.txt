AI Gaming Session Coach — Concept & Design Document
A Modern AI-Native System Optimization & Gaming Experience Assistant
1. Overview

AI Gaming Session Coach is an AI-driven desktop assistant designed to help PC gamers prepare their systems for gameplay, optimize performance intelligently, monitor the system during gaming, and provide insights after the session.

It focuses on system-level optimization, not gameplay skill coaching.
It uses modern AI patterns—agents, RAG, MCP tools, and system telemetry—to deliver a uniquely helpful user experience that solves real performance issues faced by gamers every day.

This document serves as a white-paper-style blueprint for building the MVP end-to-end.

2. Problem Space

PC gamers frequently struggle with:

Random FPS drops

Thermal throttling

Stutters caused by background tasks

Poorly chosen graphic settings

Inefficient GPU/CPU power states

Confusing Windows/NVIDIA/AMD settings

Games performing worse over time due to system clutter

Today, gamers rely on:

YouTube guides

Reddit posts

Manual settings tweaking

Trial and error

No current tool combines system control + AI reasoning + game-specific knowledge.
This creates a perfect opportunity for an AI-native optimization assistant.

3. Solution Summary

AI Gaming Session Coach is an autonomous AI that:

Before gaming

Detects the game the user intends to launch

Runs a “pre-game optimization checklist”

Adjusts power modes

Kills unnecessary background processes

Cleans temp memory

Tunes display/refresh rate

Applies GPU profile

Suggests optimal in-game settings (via RAG)

During gaming

Monitors real-time:

CPU/GPU usage

Temps and thermal throttling

RAM/VRAM usage

Performance spikes

Sends lightweight system alerts

Explains bottlenecks in human language

Suggests quick fixes

After gaming

Generates a session summary:

Performance stability

Thermal profile

Detected bottlenecks

Graphics settings recommendations

Storage/memory cleanup suggestions

Hardware upgrade suggestions

4. Target Users

Everyday PC gamers

Competitive players

6. Core Features (MVP)
A. Pre-Session Optimization

Toggle Windows power mode to “High Performance”

Close CPU/RAM-heavy apps

Clear temp files

Set GPU to max performance mode

Disable unnecessary startup background apps

Check for outdated drivers

Adjust screen color mode/perf mode

B. Real-Time System Monitoring

CPU/GPU temps

Clock speeds

VRAM/RAM use

Background CPU spikes

Percent thermal throttle

GPU/CPU utilization graphs

C. Smart Alerts

“Chrome is using 1.5 GB RAM—close it?”

“GPU hit 87°C—fans increased.”

“VRAM maxed out—lower textures to High.”

D. Game-Specific RAG Knowledge

RAG corpus includes:

Pro settings guides

Best graphic settings for each title

Known issues

Troubleshooting steps

Optimal GPU/NVIDIA control panel settings

FPS/performance trade-offs

E. Post-Session Insights

Stability score

Bottleneck analysis

Thermal trends

Recommendations for next session

Hardware upgrade suggestions

7. Architecture Overview
A. Frontend Options

Electron

Tauri

Qt

Simple local web UI (React + local server)

B. Backend Core

Python

MCP Tools (system agents)

Agent Orchestration Layer

RAG Vector Database (ChromaDB or LanceDB)

System Telemetry Collectors (Python libraries)

8. Modern AI Components
1. Agents

Session Prep Agent
Optimizes system pre-game using MCP tools.

Monitoring Agent
Watches telemetry and triggers alerts.

Game Guide Agent
Uses RAG to provide per-title recommendations.

Insight Agent
Generates post-session summaries.

Great for showing orchestration and multi-agent design.

2. RAG

Corpus includes:

Game optimization guides

GPU tuning documents

Best settings per game

Common thermal solutions

FPS troubleshooting guides

RAG is essential because:

Knowledge changes frequently

Different games have different bottlenecks

You want contextual, grounded answers

3. MCP Tools (most important tech component)

MCP tools act as bridges between AI and your device.

MCP tools you’ll create:

get_system_info

monitor_thermals

set_power_mode

kill_background_tasks

get_gpu_state

set_refresh_rate

clean_temp_files

fetch_running_processes

This teaches you real-world AI engineering:

The AI isn’t “pretending”—it actually performs tasks.

These tools make the assistant capable, not just conversational.

9. Technical Challenges & Mitigation
Challenge	Details	How to Handle
Hardware diversity	Different GPUs, CPUs, laptops	Focus MVP on Windows & NVIDIA/Intel
Access to deep GPU controls	Some functions require OEM SDKs	Use publicly accessible APIs + simple controls
Continuous monitoring	Needs efficient polling	Use event-driven or low-frequency polling
RAG dataset quality	Needs clean data	Curate small but high-quality documents
Real-time alerts	Must be non-intrusive	Use lightweight desktop notifications

All challenges are manageable for a solo builder.
