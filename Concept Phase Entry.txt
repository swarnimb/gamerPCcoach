AI Gaming Session Coach — Concept & Design Document
A Modern AI-Native System Optimization & Gaming Experience Assistant
1. Overview

AI Gaming Session Coach is an AI-driven desktop assistant designed to help PC gamers prepare their systems for gameplay, optimize performance intelligently, monitor the system during gaming, and provide insights after the session.

It focuses on system-level optimization, not gameplay skill coaching.
It uses modern AI patterns—agents, RAG, MCP tools, and system telemetry—to deliver a uniquely helpful user experience that solves real performance issues faced by gamers every day.

This document serves as a white-paper-style blueprint for building the MVP end-to-end.

2. Problem Space

PC gamers frequently struggle with:

Random FPS drops

Thermal throttling

Stutters caused by background tasks

Poorly chosen graphic settings

Inefficient GPU/CPU power states

Confusing Windows/NVIDIA/AMD settings

Games performing worse over time due to system clutter

Today, gamers rely on:

YouTube guides

Reddit posts

Manual settings tweaking

Trial and error

No current tool combines system control + AI reasoning + game-specific knowledge.
This creates a perfect opportunity for an AI-native optimization assistant.

3. Solution Summary

AI Gaming Session Coach is an autonomous AI that:

Before gaming

Detects the game the user intends to launch

Asks user to select their performance persona:
  - "Max FPS" (competitive gaming priority)
  - "Balanced" (optimized mix of quality and performance)
  - "Quiet/Cool" (thermal and noise priority)
  - "Visual Quality" (maximum graphics fidelity)

Runs a "pre-game optimization checklist"

PC-level optimizations:
  - Adjusts Windows power modes
  - Kills unnecessary background processes
  - Cleans temp memory
  - Tunes display/refresh rate
  - Applies GPU performance profile

Game-level optimizations:
  - Suggests optimal in-game graphics settings (via RAG)
  - Recommends resolution/render scale
  - Configures ray tracing, DLSS/FSR, texture quality
  - Tailors all settings to user's selected persona

During gaming

6. Core Features (MVP)
A. User Persona Selection

User chooses their priority on first launch or per-game:
  - Max FPS: Prioritizes frame rate over visuals
  - Balanced: Optimized mix of performance and quality
  - Quiet/Cool: Minimizes thermals and fan noise
  - Visual Quality: Maximum graphics fidelity

B. Pre-Session Optimization

PC-Level Adjustments:
  - Toggle Windows power mode (High/Balanced based on persona)
  - Close CPU/RAM-heavy apps
  - Clear temp files
  - Set GPU performance mode (max/balanced/quiet based on persona)
  - Disable unnecessary startup background apps
  - Check for outdated drivers
  - Adjust screen color mode/perf mode

Game-Level Recommendations:
  - Suggest graphics preset (Low/Medium/High/Ultra)
  - Recommend resolution and render scale
  - Configure ray tracing settings
  - Set DLSS/FSR/XeSS upscaling
  - Adjust shadow quality, texture quality, view distance
  - All tailored to user's selected persona and hardware

C. Real-Time System Monitoring

CPU/GPU temps

Clock speeds

VRAM/RAM use

Background CPU spikes

Percent thermal throttle

GPU/CPU utilization graphs

D. Smart Alerts

“Chrome is using 1.5 GB RAM—close it?”

“GPU hit 87°C—fans increased.”

“VRAM maxed out—lower textures to High.”

E. Game-Specific RAG Knowledge

RAG corpus includes:

Pro settings guides

Best graphic settings for each title (per persona type)

Known issues

Troubleshooting steps

Optimal GPU/NVIDIA control panel settings

FPS/performance trade-offs

Hardware-specific recommendations (e.g., "RTX 3060 Ti users: use High textures, DLSS Quality")

F. Post-Session Insights

Stability score

Bottleneck analysis

Thermal trends

Recommendations for next session (PC and game settings)

Persona adjustment suggestions (e.g., "You could switch to 'Balanced' for better visuals without losing much FPS")

Hardware upgrade suggestions

7. Architecture Overview
A. Distribution Strategy

Standalone executable (.exe) for Windows
Users download and install—no Python, Node.js, or dependencies needed
Bundled using Electron + PyInstaller or Tauri
Auto-update capability for seamless version updates

B. Frontend Options

Electron (recommended for easy distribution)

Tauri (lighter alternative)

Simple local web UI (React + local server)

C. Backend Core

Python (bundled into executable)

MCP Tools (system agents)

Agent Orchestration Layer

RAG Vector Database (ChromaDB or LanceDB)

System Telemetry Collectors (Python libraries)

8. Modern AI Components
1. Agents

Session Prep Agent
Optimizes system pre-game using MCP tools.
Applies persona-based PC and game settings.

Monitoring Agent
Watches telemetry and triggers alerts.
Adjusts settings dynamically based on persona and performance.

Game Guide Agent
Uses RAG to provide per-title recommendations.
Tailors suggestions to user's selected persona and detected hardware.

Insight Agent
Generates post-session summaries.
Suggests persona adjustments based on actual performance data.

Great for showing orchestration and multi-agent design.

2. RAG

Corpus includes:

Game optimization guides

GPU tuning documents

Best settings per game

Common thermal solutions

FPS troubleshooting guides

RAG is essential because:

Knowledge changes frequently

Different games have different bottlenecks

You want contextual, grounded answers

3. MCP Tools (most important tech component)

MCP tools act as bridges between AI and your device.

MCP tools you'll create:

get_system_info

monitor_thermals

set_power_mode

kill_background_tasks

get_gpu_state

set_refresh_rate

clean_temp_files

fetch_running_processes

detect_game_process

get_hardware_specs

apply_fan_curve (persona-based)

This teaches you real-world AI engineering:

The AI isn’t “pretending”—it actually performs tasks.

These tools make the assistant capable, not just conversational.

9. Technical Challenges & Mitigation
Challenge	Details	How to Handle
Hardware diversity	Different GPUs, CPUs, laptops	Focus MVP on Windows & NVIDIA/Intel
Access to deep GPU controls	Some functions require OEM SDKs	Use publicly accessible APIs + simple controls
Continuous monitoring	Needs efficient polling	Use event-driven or low-frequency polling
RAG dataset quality	Needs clean data	Curate small but high-quality documents
